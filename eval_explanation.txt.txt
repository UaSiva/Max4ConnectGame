I HAVE MADE AN EVALUATION FUNCTION WHICH 
TAKES THE SCORE OF PLAYER 1 AND PLAYER 2
AND FINDS THE 
DIFFERENCE OF THE SQUARES OF THEM IN ORDER TO ASSIGN A UTILITY FUNCTION.

player 1 score - a
player 2 score - b

we find (a^2)-(b^2)


I ALSO DEVELOPED AN IDEA FOR ANOTHER EVAL FUNCTION 

WE GIVE STATES WITH 3 CONSECUTIVE RED/GREEN A VERY HIGH WEIGHT
STATES WITH 2 CONSECUTIVE RED/GREEN A lesser weight

we check this horizontally, vertically, diagonally 

AND FIND THE WEIGHTED SUM.

this should prove to be a good evaluation function.

unfortunately I WAS NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT it.
